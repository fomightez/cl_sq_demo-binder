***cl_sq_demo-binder:  Jupyter notebook environment for demonstrating some sequence work resources.***

A launchable, working Jupyter-based environment that has a collection of demonstrations of useful resources on command line, or also accessible in Jupyter sessions, for manipulating sequence files.

Meant to be self-contained and ready-to-go. No installations or copying of notebooks is necessary if `launch binder` is clicked. Everything will just work. Of course static version of the notebooks can also be used. I recommend rendering static versions by placing the URLs into the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). The renders provided by [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) look best and Github's rendering will often time out (your mileage may vary).


## Attributions

I tried to include attributions for each resource when they were not mine; however, let me know if you catch an oversight or you'd like to suggest an improvement.


## Technical notes

This repository is set up to make use of the binder service offered by [MyBinder.org](https://mybinder.org/). See their site for more information about Binder.
