    "    There is a related notebook available from [here dealing with missing residues in chains](https://github.com/fomightez/BernBiopython) that depends on a soon-to-be-integrated ability in Biopython's PDB module. The notebook will come up if you click on `launch binder`. (That notebook is currently using a developmental version of the module, a different one than is here and it won't work here for now. Soon though it should be moved here.)"
