It can be launched in active form from [here](https://github.com/fomightez/cl_demo-binder) and then selecting from the index to go to the 'Categorize conservation in a MSA and use that to generate molvis commands' page. The demo was put in the structure work demo series because it was mainly developed to work towards making commands for molecular visualization."
